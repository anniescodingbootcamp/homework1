          <p>I am currently a student at UCLA coding bootcamp.  I find coding computers very interesting.</p>
          <p>I went to Chapman University for undergraduate where I studied business with an emphasis in Advertising. I was in at University from 2001 through 2005.  I then went on to work in the Advertising field.  I worked for a large Advertising Agency called Heil-Brice Retail Advertising.  After doing that for several years I decided to start my own high end clothing line.  This was extremely challenging.</p>
          <p>Starting my own business was very challenging.  I had to do all the work myself and I hired an assistant designer.  After owning my own business I retired because I had made some very good investments that I could live off of. I am now interested in learning coding so I can build my own app.  The business for computer programmers is booming.  Instead of hiring a company I decided to learn coding so I could do it myself.</p>
